# History of changes

# v0.24 Release Notes

## Fixes

- Emulator buffers are now allocated dynmically. 
- Pimoroni Pico DV Demo base: Settings are accessible from within the menu again.
- Ending a game will now go back to the menu instead of rebooting the board.

# v0.23 Release Notes

- Implemented savestates [#140](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/140)
  - Up to 5 manual save state slots per game, accessible via the in-game menu (SELECT + START).
  - In-game quick savestate Save/Restore via (START + DOWN) and (START + UP).
  - Auto Save can be enabled per game, which allows to save the current state when exiting to the menu. When the game is launched, player can choose to restore that state.
  
  When loading a state, the game mostly resumes paused. Press START to continue playing.

- Added support for [Murmulator M1 and M2 boards](https://murmulator.ru). [@javavi](https://github.com/javavi)  [#150](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/150)
  - M1: RP2040/RP2350 **Note**: Untested
  - M2: RP2350 only   **Note**: Untested
- **Fruit Jam only**: Add volume controls to settings menu. Can also be changed in-game via (START + LEFT/RIGHT). Note that too high volume levels may cause distortion. (Ext speaker, advised 16 db max, internal advised 18 dB max). Latest metadata package includes a sample.wav file to test the volume level.
- Updated SMSPlusMetaData.zip: Added **sample.wav**. This sample will be played when using the Fruit Jam volume control in the settings menu. Note when **/soundrecorder.wav** is found, this file will be played in stead.
- **RP2350 only**: Updated the menu to also list .wav audio files.
- **RP2350 Only**: Added basic wav audio playback from within the menu. Press BUTTON2 or START to play the wav file. Tested with https://lonepeakmusic.itch.io/retro-midi-music-pack-1 The wav file must have the following specs:
  - 16/24 bit PCM wav files only.  (24 bit files are downsampled to 16 bit) 
  - 2ch stereo only.
  - Sample rate supported: 44100.
- **RP2350 with PSRAM only**: Record about 30 seconds of audio by pressing START to pause the game and then START + BUTTON1. Audio is recorded to **/soundrecorder.wav** on the SD-card.

## Fixes

- Fruit Jam audio fixes.
- Settings changed by in-game button combos are saved when exiting to menu.
- DVI audio volume was somewhat too low, fixed. [#146](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/issues/146)
- Workaround for memory issues on RP2040 boards: When exiting from a game, the board will be rebooted to free up memory.  

# v0.22 Release Notes

- Settings are saved to /settings_sms.dat instead of /settings.dat. This allows to have separate settings files for different emulators (e.g. pico-infonesPlus and pico-peanutGB etc.).
- Added a settings menu.
  - Main menu: press SELECT to open; adjust options without using in-game button combos.
  - In-game: press SELECT+START to open; from here you can also quit from the game.
- Switched to Fatfs R0.16.

## Fixes

- Show correct buttonlabels in menus.
- removed wrappers for f_chdir en f_cwd, fixed in Fatfs R0.16. (there was a long standing issue with f_chdir and f_cwd not working with exFAT formatted SD cards.)


# v0.21 Release Notes

- In-game hotkeys are now consistent with the other emulators. 
- On RP2350 based boards: Themed borders/bezels are shown in-game. For this you need the latest [metadata pack](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-smsplus/releases/latest/download/SMSPlusMetadata.zip) from the releases section. Download and unzip it's contents to the root of the SD card.
- Support for [Retro-bit 8 button Genesis-USB](https://www.retro-bit.com/controllers/genesis/#usb). 

# v0.20 Release Notes

- Added support for [Adafruit Fruit Jam](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6200):  
  - Uses HSTX for video output.  
  - Audio is not supported over HSTX — connect speakers via the **audio jack** or the **4–8 Ω speaker connector**.  
  - Audio is simultaneousy played through speaker and jack. Speaker audio can be muted with **Button 1**.  
  - Controller options:  
    - **USB gamepad** on USB 1.  
    - **Wii Classic controller** via [Adafruit Wii Nunchuck Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4836) on the STEMMA QT port.  
  - Two-player mode:  
    - Player 1: USB gamepad (USB 1).  
    - Player 2: Wii Classic controller.  
    - Dual USB (USB 1 + USB 2) multiplayer is **not yet supported**.  
  - Scanlines can be toggled with **SELECT + UP**.  
  - NeoPixel leds act as a VU meter. Can be toggled on or of via Button2 on the Fruit Jam, or SELECT + RIGHT on the controller.

- Added support for [Waveshare RP2350-PiZero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-pizero.htm):  
  - Gamepad must be connected via the **PIO USB port**.  
  - The built-in USB port is now dedicated to **power and firmware flashing**, removing the need for a USB-Y cable.  
  - Optional: when you solder the optional PSRAM chip on the board, the emulator will make use of it. Roms will be loaded much faster using PSRAM.

- Added support for Waveshare RP2350-USBA with PCB. More info and build guide at: https://www.instructables.com/PicoNES-RaspberryPi-Pico-Based-NES-Emulator/
- Added support for [Spotpear HDMI](https://spotpear.com/index/product/detail/id/1207.html) board.

- **RP2350 Only** Framebuffer implemented in SRAM. This eliminates the red flicker during slow operations, such as SD card I/O.

- **Cover art and metadata support**:  
  - Download pack [here](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-smsplus/releases/latest/download/SMSPlusMetadata.zip).  
  - Extract the zip contents to the **root of the SD card**.  
  - In the menu:  
    - Highlight a game and press **START** → show cover art and metadata.  
    - Press **SELECT** → show full game description.  
    - Press **B** → return to menu.  
    - Press **START** or **A** → start the game.

- Screensaver
  - Block screensaver, which is shown when no metadata is available, is replaced by static floating image.

Huge thanks to [Gavin Knight](https://github.com/DynaMight1124) for providing the metadata and images as well as testing the different builds!

## Fixes

- Audio improvements.
- misc fixes.

# v0.19 Release Notes
- PSRAM will be used if detected. (RP2350 only, default pin 47). ROMs load from the SD card into PSRAM instead of flash. This speeds up loading because the board no longer has to reboot to copy the ROM from the SD card to flash. Based on https://github.com/AndrewCapon/PicoPlusPsram Boards with PSRAM are the [Adafruit Metro RP2350 with PSRAM](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6267) and [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107).
- Added -s option to bld.sh to allow an alternative GPIO pin for PSRAM chip select.
- Added support for [Pimoroni Pico Plus 2](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-plus-2?variant=42092668289107). (Uses hardware configuration 2, which is also used for breadboard and PCB). No extra binary needed.
- In some configurations, a second USB port can be added. This port can be used to connect a gamepad. The built-in usb port will be used for power and flashing the firmware. With this there is no need to use a USB-Y cable anymore. For more info, see [pio_usb.md](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus/blob/main/pio_usb.md). You have to build the firmware from source to enable this feature. The pre-built binaries do not support this.
- Enable I2S audio on the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base. This allows audio output through external speakers connected to the line-out jack of the Pimoroni Pico DV Demo Base. You can toggle audio output to this jack with SELECT + LEFT. Thanks to [Layer812](https://github.com/Layer812) for testing and providing feedback.
- Added second PCB design for use with Waveshare [RP2040-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm) or [RP2350-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-zero.htm) mini development board. The PCB is designed to fit in a 3D-printed case. PCB and Case design by [@DynaMight1124](https://github.com/DynaMight1124).
Based around cheaper but harder to solder components for those that fancy a bigger challenge. It also allows the design to be smaller.
- Added new configuration to BoardConfigs.cmake and bld.sh to support the new configuration for this PCB.

## Fixes
- Fix crash in my_chdir that may occur on RP2040 boards.

# v0.18 Release Notes

- Save game functionality has been added for [SMS games that support it](https://consolemods.org/wiki/Master_System:List_of_Master_System_Games_with_Save_Batteries). To ensure game data is properly saved to the SD card, **you must return to the menu by pressing Select + Start.**
Save files are stored in the /SAVES directory with a .SAV extension.
When you launch the game again, the corresponding save file will be loaded automatically.


## Fixes
- none
